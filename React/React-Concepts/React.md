# React

React is a JavaScript ~~library~~ framework for building user interfaces.

https://reactjs.org/

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “_components_”.

A React component is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page. Each component is a JavaScript function that returns a piece of code that represents a piece of a web page.

Your React codebase is basically just one large pile of big components that call smaller components.

A React component is a single object that not only outputs HTML like a traditional template would, but also includes all the code needed to control that output.

The five key concepts are:

- Components
- JSX
- Props & State
- The Component API
- Component Types
